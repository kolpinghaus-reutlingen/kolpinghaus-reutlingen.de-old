Our young residents are offered the possibility to spend their free time in a meaningful way.<br>
Weâ€™ve got an internal bistro that opens in the evening offering reasonably priced drinks, snacks and a TV; a bowling lane; billiards room; table-tennis tables; several table footballs and many various board games, which are available any time.<br>
Besides, they can borrow soccer balls, handballs, volley balls, badminton, inline skates, a punching bag and more to exercise outside.<br>
Furthermore the pedagogical team offers all residents daily and various activities they can join.<br>
