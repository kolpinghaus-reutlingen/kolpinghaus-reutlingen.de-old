Besides, we are near the station and center in an area with good infrastructure.

We offer various support for everyday life that fits the young peopleâ€™s individual needs, social guidance, life counseling and always an open ear.<br>
Fun, action, culture and education are the main emphasis of our free time activities and provide a diversified everyday life.

## The team of employees

The team of employees consists of many different job profiles. Educators, administrators, cleaning staff, kitchen staff, janitors, but also volunteers are working in this house.

The entire team works according to the motto "we offer much more than a roof over your head", because we offer leisure and social education support in addition to the housing options.
